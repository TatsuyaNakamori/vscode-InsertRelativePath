Overview
########

This tool will insert a path relative to the selected file in Explorer.

You can insert any string (`Snippet <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets>`_ is also supported) before and after the relative path.
For example, if you define the format of the string to be inserted as ``<link rel="stylesheet" href="{RELPATH}">``, you can easily insert a line to load a css file.



You can define multiple formats. In that case, you will have to choose from a dialog which string to insert.
